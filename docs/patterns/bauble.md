Essential instructions for a simple, US-terminology bauble cover sized for a 4" (10 cm) plastic ornament.

## Materials
- Yarn: Big Twist Value, #4 medium (sample color: Yuletide). Substitutes: Lion Brand Mandala Ombré, Lion Brand Ferris Wheel, Bernat Super Value Ombre.
- Hook: 5 mm (H).
- Ornament: 4" plastic bauble.
- Notions: tapestry needle for seaming/gathering; ribbon or pick for hanging/embellishment.

## Gauge
- 2" square = 4 rows × 4 stitches in pattern stitch.

## Size adjustments
- Foundation chain must be a multiple of 2 and should stretch from the bauble’s bottom midpoint to the top opening for a snug fit.
- Work the rectangle until it wraps firmly around the ornament; then assemble as below.

## Pattern
### Step 1 – Crochet the rectangle
1. **Foundation:** CH 18.
2. **Row 1:** YO, insert hook in 2nd CH from hook, pull up a loop; YO, skip next CH, insert hook in next CH, pull up a loop; YO, pull through all 5 loops, CH 1. *YO, insert hook in last CH used, pull up a loop; YO, skip next ST, insert hook in next CH, pull up a loop; YO, pull through all 5 loops, CH 1;* repeat *to* across. End with HDC in last ST (already holding final group), CH 1, turn. (8 groups)
3. **Row 2:** YO, insert hook in next CH-1 space, pull up a loop; YO, skip next ST, insert hook in next CH-1 space, pull up a loop; YO, pull through all 5 loops, CH 1. *YO, insert hook in last CH-1 space, pull up a loop; YO, skip next ST, insert hook in next CH-1 space, pull up a loop; YO, pull through all 5 loops, CH 1;* repeat *to* across. End with HDC in last ST (holding final group), CH 1, turn. (8 groups)
4. **Rows 3–19:** Repeat Row 2. Fasten off leaving a ~12" tail for sewing.

### Step 2 – Assemble the ornament
1. **Close the bottom:** With the long tail and tapestry needle, weave through each row edge; pull tight to close and knot securely.
2. **Sew the side:** Mattress-stitch one foundation-chain stitch to one last-row stitch about halfway; insert the bauble; continue seaming to the top and knot.
3. **Close the top:** Thread yarn through the top foundation chain, pull tight to gather, knot, and weave in ends. Add ribbon or decorative pick.
