# Crochet pattern viewer

Welcome to the interactive crochet pattern viewer. Patterns are authored in Markdown/MDX, rendered by Docusaurus, and enhanced with:

- **Stitch abbreviation tooltips** driven by a shared abbreviations file.
- **Local progress capture** for Markdown checkboxes.
- **A per-pattern stitch counter** that persists between visits.

Use the navigation to open the sample pattern and explore the interactions.
