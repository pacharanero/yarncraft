# Project Specification

## Pattern formatting guidance
- Focus on only the information required to make the item; remove marketing text, download prompts, or other chatter.
- Present steps with clear markdown structure: headings, bulleted lists, and numbered lists. Use markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]`) to make step completion easy to track where appropriate.
- Render stitch abbreviations and other shorthand in backticks (e.g., `sc`, `hdc`) so they stand out from prose.
- Attribute the original source of each pattern explicitly by name and link.
- Keep patterns aligned with the Docusaurus docs layout by including front matter (title, sidebar metadata) and placing files in the appropriate docs directories.
- Collect stitch abbreviations into dedicated reference files (e.g., `docs/reference/abbreviations.md`) so they can be reused across patterns rather than duplicated inline.
- If images are required, use compatible formats such as PNG or JPG (avoid WebP); if an image cannot be made compatible or is unreliable, prefer removing it and keeping the pattern text-only.
- When sizing or materials are adjustable, provide concise notes on gauge, sizing rules, and assembly steps without extra commentary.
